## 2025-12-07 - Fixed All Project Issues

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Environment Configuration** - Populated empty `.env` file with all required variables
2. **Code Structure** - Fixed import order in `server.py` (all imports moved to top)
3. **Test Client** - Updated `test_client.py` with proper MCP documentation
4. **Dependencies** - Installed all required packages from `requirements.txt`

### Files Modified:
- `.env` - Added FastAPI settings, Pendle API URL, and blockchain configuration
- `server.py` - Reorganized imports to follow Python best practices
- `test_client.py` - Replaced incorrect REST API calls with MCP usage guide

### Verification:
✅ AI models working correctly
✅ FastMCP imports successfully
✅ All dependencies installed
✅ Server ready to run

### How to Run:
```bash
python server.py
```

Or test with MCP Inspector:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```
