Update Log
2025-12-07 — All Issues Resolved
What Was Fixed:
Environment Setup
The .env file was empty, so all the required environment variables were added.

.env — Added FastAPI configs, Pendle API URL, and blockchain settings.
test_client.py — Updated to use MCP correctly instead of REST.
Status Check:
1. AI models are functioning correctly
2. FastMCP imports are working
